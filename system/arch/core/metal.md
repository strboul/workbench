## UEFI

- Disable touchscreen if any.

- Switch Function (F) keys with media keys, e.g. pressing <kbd>F1</kbd> should
  mute, and pressing <kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> opens help.

## Keyboard

- ANSI standard

- <kbd>\`~</kbd> is on the top left 2nd row below F-keys.

- <kbd>Fn</kbd> is 2nd key from the bottom left of <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.

Dell keyboards seems the best following this format.
