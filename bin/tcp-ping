# TCP based ping
#
# Useful if ICMP is blocked and if other TCP based ping tools aren't available.
# No external dependency other than sh is needed so it can be used in servers
# having no access to the package tools.
#
# Usage:
#   tcp-ping 127.0.0.1 3000
#   tcp-ping localhost 3000
#   tcp-ping archlinux.org 443
#
