# dotfiles

Tested on macOS (`10.14 mojave`) and Debian (`9 stretch`).

## Installation

Having [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed is the prerequisite.

Clone this repo in your home directory (`~/` or `$HOME/`). Change
directory into this `dotfiles` folder and execute the setup script:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:strboul/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles && ./setup.sh
```

## Brewfile

For macOS, [brew](https://brew.sh/) is a nice package manager to install
command-line and binary applications in easy way. In the `~/dotfiles/install` directory,
run this to install everything inside the `Brewfile`:
```
brew bundle
```
